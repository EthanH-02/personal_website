# personal_website
A challenge into web dev experience and working on creating a personal profile.

This was inspired by me wanting to undertake a small blog and portfolio that could challenge me and give me something to attempt within my free time. I hope you enjoy the progress that I make and wish for you to follow along.

Right now my goal is too add a basic profile with a few cool smaller features and will keep up to date as it goes along! Hopefully I can have this hosted and use it as a personal website to show my skills and practice off to the world 	(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧.
